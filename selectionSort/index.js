 * This an implementation of the  selection sort sort algorithm which consists of repeatedly swaping the smallest

 * Time complexity = O(nÂ²) => double looping over the elements 
 * Space complexity = O(1) => algorithm does not need extra space, reorders elements in place
 * @param {*} arr 
 * @returns a  sorted array
